# NPC Generator

Here I built something fun with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6). You can see it
online [here](https://captainalan.github.io/npc_generator/). Everything is static
contentâ€”hooray!

## Take Home Lessons

- Writing HTML directly with JavaScript may work for very small projects, but it
  is no good. This is why more modern front-end/view solutions (e.g. React) encourage other
  ways to do things.
- Nice HTML makes scripting CSS with JavaScript much easier.
