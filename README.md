# NPC Generator

Here I built something fun with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6). You can see it
online at [here](http://haksayng.com/npc_generator/). Everything is static
content.

## Take Home Lessons

- Writing HTML directly with JavaScript may work for very small projects, but it
  is *no bueno* overall. This is why Web Frameworks (e.g. React) encourage other
  ways to do things.
- Nice HTML makes scripting CSS with JavaScript much easier.
